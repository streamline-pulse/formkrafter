# @streamline-pulse/formkrafter-core

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 700b6f9: New `convertFormioForm(form)` in the core: converts a Form.io form definition into a FormKrafter spec.

  - Inputs: textfield, textarea, number, currency, password, email, url, phoneNumber, datetime/day/time, checkbox, selectboxes, select (static values, multiple, remote url with valueProperty/template/searchField), radio, tags, hidden, file, signature, address.
  - Layout: panel/fieldset/well/container → group, columns → row + columns, tabs → tabs, datagrid/editgrid → data-grid, wizard display → stepper.
  - Validations (required, min/maxLength, min/max, pattern, customMessage) and simple conditionals (`show/when/eq` → hidden rule in json-logic) carry over.
  - Anything unmappable is reported in the returned `warnings` array instead of failing.

- 00bba5a: Recap brick, URL uploads and Form.io converter hardening.

  - New `recap` brick (output): live summary of every filled entry of the form — labels resolved per locale, option values shown as their labels, collections listed row by row, rule-hidden and `_`-private fields excluded. Powered by a new `rootSpec` prop available to all bricks.
  - New `UrlFileUploadService` in the core: multipart upload to a configurable URL (global default or per-brick `uploadUrl` config) with `remove()` support; the file brick now calls `remove` when a file is cleared and shows upload/delete errors.
  - Form.io converter: `dataSrc: "json"` select options, `validate.custom` auto-converted to a sandboxed custom validator, javascript `logic` triggers converted to rules, `filePattern`/`multiple`/storage URL mapping, empty validation bounds ignored, and conditional visibility now wins over the `hidden` flag.
  - radio and select-boxes bricks accept object-shaped options (`[{ label, value }]`) and store values while displaying labels.
